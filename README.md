# CodeSignalPractice

This repo will contain Python practice code that is both a showcase of the progress I have made to becoming a better programmer but also so that I can come back to reinforce said material should it come up. This will also probably contain any future language practice maybe like R or C. I decide to take once it comes up but for now its mostly Python.
I will consider adding any CodeSignal Arcade here as well.
